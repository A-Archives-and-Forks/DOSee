# DOSee

## Usage & customisations

It is easy to customise DOSee to load other MS-DOS programs by using HTML5 `<meta>` elements. A [index.html](index.html) file is the identifier which contains 6 meta elements used by DOSee for handling emulation information and customisation.

```html
<!-- DOSee initialisation options -->
<meta
  name="dosee:zip:path"
  content="dos_programs/program_4/agi_demo_pack_1.zip"
/>
<meta name="dosee:run:filename" content="sierra.com" />

<meta name="dosee:capture:filename" content="screenshot.png" />
<meta name="dosee:utilities" content="false" />
<meta name="dosee:audio:gus" content="false" />
<meta name="dosee:width:height" content="640, 400" />
```

#### Required

#### `<meta name="dosee:zip:path">`

DOSee uses ZIP file archives to simulate a hard disk drive. Any ZIP file provided to _dosee:zip:path_ will be mounted by the emulator as MS-DOS drive `C:`. The `C:` drive will be accessible to all DOS commands such as `dir C:` and any included DOS programs available to run.

The meta _content_ attribute must be a relative path from the web root and needs to point to a ZIP file archive.

✓ `<meta name="dosee:zip:path" content="dos_programs/example/dosgame.zip" />`

✗ `<meta name="dosee:zip:path" content="/home/me/DOSee/dos_programs/example/dosgame.zip" />`

#### `<meta name="dosee:run:filename">`

The filename of the MS-DOS program DOSee should launch. The program file needs to exist in the ZIP archive provided to _dosee:zip:path_.

DOS usually uses the following file extensions to identify a program: `.exe` `.com` `.bat`. Other than these there is no standard file naming convention to identify which file should be used to launch a piece of DOS software.

If the content is left blank or the filename doesn't exist in the archive, DOSee will launch into an DOS `C:` prompt.

✓ `<meta name="dosee:run:filename" content="game.exe" />`

#### Optional

#### `<meta name="dosee:capture:filename">`

The filename used by the capture tool to save emulator screenshots. The PNG images should include the `.png` file extension.

✓ `<meta name="dosee:capture:filename" content="game.png" />`

✗ `<meta name="dosee:capture:filename" content="game" />`

#### `<meta name="dosee:utilities">`

When set to `true` it tells DOSee to mount a collection of MS-DOS utilities and tools that are accessible from the `U:` drive. The default option is false.

✓ `<meta name="dosee:utilities" content="true" />`

✓ `<meta name="dosee:utilities" content="false" />`

#### `<meta name="dosee:width:height">`

Configures the initial pixel width and height of the emulation loading screen and canvas. The canvas may readjust itself after the emulator runs depending on the graphics hardware selection, scale options and aspect correction settings. The default canvas and screen size is 640px x 480px.

✓ `<meta name="dosee:width:height" content="640,400" />`

✗ `<meta name="dosee:width:height" content="640px, 400px" />`

#### Placeholders

#### `<meta name="dosee:audio:gus">`

When set to `true` it tells DOSee to mount a collection of Gravis Ultrasound audio drivers and tools that are accessible from the `G:` drive. These drivers are always loaded by DOSee whenever the Gravis Ultrasound audio option is selected so this should always be left to `false`.

#### Sample programs

There are three additional sample programs included in this repository that you can try out. In the [index.html](index.html) update the following `<meta>` elements.

```html
<!-- DOSee initialisation options -->
<meta
  name="dosee:zip:path"
  content="dos_programs/program_4/agi_demo_pack_1.zip"
/>
<meta name="dosee:run:filename" content="sierra.com" />
```

Sample program 1 (fastest, VGA, Gravis Ultrasound)

```html
<meta name="dosee:zip:path" content="dos_programs/program_1/df2intro.zip" />
<meta name="dosee:run:filename" content="DF2.EXE" />
```

Sample program 2 (fastest, VGA, Gravis Ultrasound)

```html
<meta name="dosee:zip:path" content="dos_programs/program_2/df2.zip" />
<meta name="dosee:run:filename" content="df2.exe" />
```

Sample program 3 (fastest, VGA, Sound Blaster 16)

```html
<meta name="dosee:zip:path" content="dos_programs/program_3/hyb605.zip" />
<meta name="dosee:run:filename" content="hyb605.exe" />
```

#### Add new software example

Create a new program subdirectory. For your own implementation, there is no requirement to follow this `dos_programs/` directory naming structure.

```
cd DOSee
mkdir -p dos_programs/program_5
```

Download the [Space Quest 3 non-interactive demo](https://www.scummvm.org/frs/demos/sci/sq3-dos-ni-demo-en.zip) and save it to the new program subdirectory.

```
wget -O dos_programs/program_5/sq3-demo.zip https://www.scummvm.org/frs/demos/sci/sq3-dos-ni-demo-en.zip
```

Update the DOSee [index.html](index.html) to launch the demo and enjoy the confusing mess that is the MS-DOS era of computer games.

```html
<!-- DOSee initialisation options -->
<meta name="dosee:zip:path" content="dos_programs/program_5/sq3-demo.zip" />
<meta name="dosee:run:filename" content="SQ3DEMO.BAT" />
```
